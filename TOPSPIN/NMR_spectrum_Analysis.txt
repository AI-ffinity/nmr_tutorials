## INTEGRATE 1D SPECTRUM (Manual 12.3 1D Interactive Integration, p. 203)
##

* To switch to Inegration mode enter .int on the command line.
* Integrate manually all peacks in the N-H region (~6.5-10.2 ppm). Interactive bias or slope correction do not help.
* Click Save Region as...->Save & Show list, then save the list of peak integrals into a file for future reference.
* Select a peack that you believe corresponds to a single NH-NH, right click->Calibrate Current Integral and set it to 1.0. This will set automatically all other integrals
  to multiple of the selected reference peak and will help you count the number of NH-NH signals in each multiple peak. Save these numbers if you want as above.
  To find out your reference peak was correct do:
  awk "NR>5" 58/pdata/1/1D_normalized_peak_integrals.txt | awk '{sum+=$4} END { print "",sum}'
  This must give you a number close to N-1, where N you number of residues in the peptide.
* You can optionaly try to deconvolute a complicated peak by right click on the peak integral->Deconvolution->Deconvolute & display Integrals. Howeve, I din't find it accurate.
