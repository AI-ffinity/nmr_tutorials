* select a previous proton pulse calibration experiment (e.g. `zg`) conducted on the same spectrometer and hit `edc` to create a new folder and copy it there.
* hit `edte` to set the temperature
* enter the sample to the spectrometer
* hit `lock` and select the right solvent (e.g. "H2O+D2O").

[10:20] you must wait ~10 minutes for temperature stabilization but in the meantime we can setup the HSQC experiment

* [11:09] to create a new experiment, hit `edc`, select "Read parameterset", then select and pick the right HSQC pulse sequence (e.g. "HSQCETF3FGPSI"). Then select "Execute getprosol" and write the description under "Title" text box. Finally, click "OK".
* [14:50] Hit `edasp` to check for correctness of the channels.
* Open the parameters' table with `eda`. First, set the following parameters: SW, O1P, AQ. Then adjust TD, DS, NS based on the estimated experimental time, which can be calculated with `expt`.
* [26:49] Initate automatic matching and tuning with `atmm`. Select the "15N" dimension and click "Start" under "Automatic adjustment". Repeat it for the "1H" dimension. Once finished start the manual matching and tuning. The goal is to bring the minimum at the center, lowest point both on 1H and 15N dimensions.
* hit `loopadj` to optimize the lock parameters
* [43:06] hit `topshim gui` for automatic shimming. Because we use Shigemi tube, go to "PARAMETERS" and write "plot".
* [44:20] Open TopshimData -> 1D_maps_field -> zg30 to see the profil of the magnetic field of our sample in the Shigemi tube. Write down the range of the liquid (-0.881 cm to 0.84 cm in our case).
* [46:55] hit again `topshim gui`, select "3D", toggle on "Use Z6", set "Before" and "After" to "Z-X-Y-XZ-YZ-Z", under "PARAMETERS" write "zrange=-0.881,0.84" and hit "Start".

#~ from here it begins the recording ~#
==> add snapshots!
* hit `zg` to lauch the measurement of 1D proton
* once recording finished hit `fp`.
* hit `.ph` to manually phase the spectrum. Save and return.
* hit `ased` and then `1 P1 15.59*4`.
