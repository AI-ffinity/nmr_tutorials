- we don't need to phase N and C dimensions.
- Before starting processing, make a copy of your 2D with `wrpa`, zoom into a small area of 
overlapping peaks, open the original 2D in another window next to the replica, click on "exactzoom"
icon and set the same window dimensions in both spectra.
- we can increase the SI size of direct dimension up to twice the next power of 2 to increase resolution.
The rest we can increase up to four times (e.g. if 15N is 256 we can do it 1024).
- `xfb` for the changes to take effect. The peaks should look more rounded.
- For further resolution set SSB of direct dimension to 2.2.
- `xfb` for the changes to take effect.

# Baseline Correction
- set left "ABSF1" and right "ABSF2" limit in the direct dimension to cover the left side of the spectrum before
 the water line (~4.5 ppm), otherwise the polynomial function will be confused and will remove
the water line but will fill in the rest of the spectrum with noise. So be careful where you
set the right limit "ABSF2".
- select "qpol" function. "qfil" suppressed water very agressively.



## NOTE: 1D 1H is assential for quality control. We can see whether the sample is clean if there are admixtures, 
how the water looks. You can detect false alarms from glycerol, from histidine, from anything. The degradation
can be also seen in the 2D.
