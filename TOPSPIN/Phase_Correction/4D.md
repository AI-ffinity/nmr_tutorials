# Phase Correction in 4D Spectra

Phase correction in 4D spectra follows a similar workflow as in 2D spectra. The process involves performing NUS reconstruction, extracting projections, and then phase-correcting them.

## Steps for Phase Correction

1. **NUS Reconstruction:**
   - Execute `ftnd 0` for NUS reconstruction.

2. **Extract Projections:**
   - Use the command `projplp 34 all all 34` to extract the 34 projection.

3. **Create Imaginary Dimensions:**
   - Run `xht1` and `xht2` on the 34 projection to create the imaginary dimensions.

4. **Phase Correction:**
   - Phase correct only on F4.
   - Note: The process was not completed because Karel had to leave, and it was unclear whether the new PHC0 and PHC1 values were saved to the 34 projection.

5. **Apply Phase Correction to 4D:**
   - Copy the PHC0 and PHC1 values to the 4D spectrum.
   - Execute `pknd 4`.

### Alternative Method

1. **Extract HN-N Plane:**
   - Extract one HN-N plane from the 4D spectrum.

2. **Phase Correction:**
   - Perform phase correction on the extracted plane.
   - Copy the PHC0 and PHC1 values to the 4D spectrum.
   - Execute `pknd 4`.

# Baseline Correction

Baseline correction does not have a significant effect on 4D spectra. It should be considered a final touch that does not affect the peak shape.
