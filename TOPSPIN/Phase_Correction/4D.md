# Phase Correction in 4D Spectra
Phase correction in the 4D follows the same workflow as in the 2D. We simply perform NUS reconstruction with `ftnd 0`,
extract projections, e.g. `projplp 34 all all 34` and then phase-correct them.
- first create the imaginary dimensions with `xht1` and `xht2` on the 34 projection.
- Phase correct only on F4; we haven't finished it because Karel had to leave. We were also not sure whether it saves
the new PHC0, PHC1 values to the 34 projection.
- copy the PHC0, PHC1 values to the 4D and execute `pknd 4`.

Alternatively, you can extract one HN-N plane from the 4D and do the phase correction there, copy PHC0, PHC1 values to 
the 4D and execute `pknd 4`.

# Baseline Correction
It doesn't have significant effect on the 4D. It should be the final touch that doesn't affect the peak shape.
