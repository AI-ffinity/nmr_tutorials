## Setting Parameters
- we don't need to phase N and C dimensions.
- Before starting processing, make a copy of your 2D with `wrpa`, zoom into a small area of 
overlapping peaks, open the original 2D in another window next to the replica, click on "exactzoom"
icon and set the same window dimensions in both spectra.
- we can increase the SI size of direct dimension up to twice the next power of 2 to increase resolution.
The rest we can increase up to four times (aka "zero filling"), e.g. if 15N is 256 we can do it 1024.
- `xfb` for the changes to take effect. The peaks should look more rounded.
- For further resolution set SSB of direct dimension to 2.2.
- `xfb` for the changes to take effect.

## Baseline Correction
There are two polynomyal functions: 1) the "BC_mod" that multiplies the FID (time domain) at the very beginning before 
the FT (takes effect after `xfb`), and 2) the abs for baseline correction ("ABSG", "ABSF1", "ABSF2") on the processed spectrum.
- set left "ABSF1" and right "ABSF2" limit in the direct dimension (F2); in 15N HSQC to cover the left side of the spectrum before
 the water line (~4.5 ppm), otherwise the polynomial function will be confused and will remove
the water line but will fill in the rest of the spectrum with noise. So be careful where you
set the right limit "ABSF2". In general for 15N HSQC ABSF2 >= 5.0. In the indirect dimension you can leave the default
"ABSF1" and "ABSF2" values.
- select "qpol" function. "qfil" suppressed water very aggressively and it's not recommended for 15N HSQC.
- The 13C dimension is very sensitive to the "BC_mod" polynomyal, that's why it's recommended to avoid it.
- `xfb` for FT, followed by `abs1`, `abs2` for baseline correction. You can se above each axis the 1D peaks, which
compared to the original 2D spectrum, has sharper and better resoluted peaks thanks to "zero filling" and increased SSB.

# Linear Prediction
- NUS and LP should not be combined. NUS simulates fitfully the whole FID, while LP simulated the FID decay that was 
truncated out. As such, NUS reconstruction substitutes LP. Consequently, LP must not be applied to any spectrum (4D, 3D)
recorded with NUS.

At the top is a full-point sampled spectrum or traditional planes, the red line is the addition made by LP. At the bottom is a spectrum 
recorded with NUS *green dotted lines) and after NUS reconstruction (black line). Here LP has no effect (red line).
- LP is recommended only for the 15N and 13C dimensions without NUS, not for 1H dimensions (F2). That's because the 1H signal stops
at the marked point and from then only noise is recorded. The remining could be truncated to improve S/N.

- You can play with NCOEF, e.g. increase it from 32 to 48 in the indirect dimension and then `xfb`.

## NOTE: 1D 1H is essential for quality control. We can see whether the sample is clean if there are admixtures, 
how the water looks. You can detect false alarms from glycerol, from histidine, from anything. The degradation
can be also seen in the 2D.

## Phase Correction
- `.ph`
- Select two peaks from one edge of the 2D spectrum and one from the opposite edge as well as at least one in the 
intermediate. It is important to cover the whole spectrum to monitor the effect the phase correction of one peak has 
on distant peaks.
