* In the same way you can correct the phase in the direct dimension of the 4D spectrum.

* Select the "MDD" method under the "NUS" window and execute `ftnd 0` for NUS reconstruction.
* `.ls` to save the current contours in the 3D spectrum visualization.

## SUMMARY OF COMMANDS AND STEPS
1. create the macro `edmac qfp`
2. turn off the real prediction in the indirect dimensions F1 and F2 with `1 ME_mod no` and `2 ME_mod no`, which is 
useful only when you record justa few points in the indirect dimensions, otherwise it will be harmful.
3. truncate the direct dimension by a few points `3 TDeff 1400`
4. `ftnd 0 nusft` for Fourier definition without NUS reconstruction with MDD/CC (very fast). 
5. click the "cube icon" to view the 3D spectrum and the icons next to it to view the individual planes. The plane will
move in depth when you scroll on the "up and down arrow". Find one plane whose peak phases you don't like and then 
execute `slice` to extract it. This will open a window and ask you for the "plane number" to extract, which is displayed
 at the bottom left with red letters. Give at "Destination PROCNO" the indices of the selected dimensions, e.g. "23" 
 for F2-F3 plane.
6. reconstruct the imaginary dimension on the plane with `xht1`. Without imaginary data you cannot correct the phases. FYI, file 
`3rrr` contains the spectrum in real space, which `3iri`, `3irr`, `3rir`, `3iir`, 3iii`, have at least one dimension in
 imaginary space.
7. `.ph` for interactive phase correction or from the menu "Adjust Phase".
8. select a peak, right mouse click, "Add", click on the "C up-down arrow" and the adjust the phase by scrolling on the
 "0" icon. Once you finish click on the "Save 3D" icon, which will transfer your phase corrections on the 1D to the 
 3D spectrum.
