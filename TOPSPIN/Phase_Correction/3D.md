# Phase Correction in 3D Protein Spectra

In the 3D spectrum, phase correction is done for every dimension individually. The same method can be used to correct 
the phase in the direct dimension of a 4D spectrum, but not in the indirect dimensions (?).

## Summary of Commands and Steps

1. **Open the Raw 3D Spectrum:**
   - Navigate to "PROCPARS -> Fourier -> Phase Correction" and check the values of `PHC0` and `PHC1`.
   - If these values are other than zero, the spectrum may already be phased.

2. **Fourier Transformation:**
   - Select the "MDD" method within the "NUS" window.
   - Execute the command `ftnd 0 nusft` for Fourier transformation without NUS reconstruction. This step helps in visualizing the spectrum and deciding on the dimensions to truncate.

3. **Visualization and Dimension Truncation:**
   - Select the processed spectrum.
   - Use the "cube icon" to view the 3D spectrum and adjacent icons to explore individual planes.
   - Note that the F3 (HN) dimension often contains a lot of empty space below 5.5 ppm, which can be truncated by typing `SI/2` in the `STSI` field.

4. **Determine Region of Interest (ROI):**
   - Access the 15N HSQC to identify the ROI in `ppm` in the HN dimension.
   - Return to the processed 3D spectrum and determine the bin indices of the ROI.
   - Set the variables `STSR` and `STSI` in the F3 dimension under `PROCPARS`, or use the command `3 TDeff 1400` to truncate the direct dimension appropriately.

5. **Create and Edit Macros:**
   - Create a macro using the command `edmac qfp`.
   - In the editor that opens, write the following commands to save and process the spectrum:
     ```sh
     qsin
     fp
     ```

6. **Execute Phase Correction Macro:**
   - Run the command `qfp`.
   - In the pop-up window, set "1" at "FID" and "2" at "PROCNO".

7. **Refresh Graphical Display:**
   - Use the command `.gr` to refresh the graphical display, reflecting recent changes.

8. **Adjust Phase and Save Changes:**
   - From the menu, select "Adjust Phase".
   - Drag on the "0" icon and click on the "save nD" icon to apply your changes to the 3D spectrum.

9. **Disable Linear Prediction:**
   - Navigate to `PROCPARS -> FOURIER`.
   - Set the parameter "ME_mod" to `no` for all dimensions to turn off Linear Prediction in the indirect dimensions F1 and F2. This is beneficial when only a few points are recorded in these dimensions; otherwise, it might be detrimental.

10. **Re-execute Fourier Transformation:**
    - Run `ftnd 0 nusft` again to perform the Fourier transformation without NUS reconstruction.

11. **NUS Reconstruction:**
    - Execute `ftnd 0` for NUS reconstruction.

12. **Review and Adjust Peaks in 3D View:**
    - Return to the 3D view by clicking the cube icon.
    - Click on the "/8" icon to display the peaks. Adjust the contour levels with your mouse.
    - Click on the "aim" icon to switch to the 2D plane view. You can navigate through different planes using the "up and down arrows" icon. Identify a plane where peak phases are unsatisfactory.

13. **Extract and Process a Specific Plane:**
    - Execute `slice` to extract the problematic plane.
    - A window will ask for the "plane number" (displayed at the bottom left in red letters). Enter "Destination PROCNO" with indices corresponding to the selected dimensions, such as "23" for the F2-F3 plane.

14. **Reconstruct Imaginary Dimension for Phase Correction:**
    - Use `xht1` or navigate through the menu "Advanced -> Special Transforms -> Hilbert in F1" to reconstruct the imaginary dimension, essential for correcting the phase of the F1 dimension.
    - Note: Files like `3rrr` represent the spectrum in real space, whereas files such as `3iri`, `3irr`, `3rir`, `3iir`, and `3iii` contain at least one imaginary dimension.

15. **Interactive Phase Correction:**
    - Utilize the command `.ph` for interactive phase correction or select "Adjust Phase" from the menu.
    - Select a peak, right-click, choose "Add", then adjust the phase by clicking on the "C up-down arrow" and dragging on the "0" icon.
    - Once satisfied with the adjustments, click on the "Save 3D" icon to apply your 1D phase corrections to the entire 3D spectrum.
