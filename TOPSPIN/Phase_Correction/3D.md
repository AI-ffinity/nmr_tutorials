# Phase Correction in 3D Protein Spectra

------------------------------------------

In the 3D spectrum, phase correction is done for every dimension individually. **SOLUTION 1** is **only** for the d**irect 
(F3) dimension**, while **SOLUTION 2** is for every dimension. I **strongly recommend using them in combination**.

## Solution 1: Phase-Correct the **1st FID (F3)**

The **1st (strongest) FID** always corresponds to the **direct (F3) dimension**. Therefore, you **cannot phase F2 and F3 with this solution.**

**Example Data:** Raw_Spectra/Carbonic_Anhydrase_2/hCA2-wt_950/83

**[Download example data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10-3H7bdsclmshQy3XCQaV6QQJ84Hi71X?usp=drive_link)**

1. **Reset all F4 phase values to `0`:**
   > **Important:** Look at the bottom of the pulse program to find the correct PHC0 and PHC1 values of F1-F3 - if 
there are any. 
   - Set all phase values to zero with the following commands: 
```
3 PHC0 0
3 PHC1 0
2 PHC0 0
2 PHC1 0
1 PHC0 0
1 PHC1 0
```
   - Reset truncation boundaries with the following commands:
```
3 TDeff 0
2 TDeff 0
1 TDeff 0
3 STSR 0
2 STSR 0
1 STSR 0
3 STSI 0
2 STSI 0
1 STSI 0
```
   - You may want to increase the points in any dimension (`SI`) by x2 or x4 times (**zero filling**) to enhance 
resolution. Ensure that **all SI values are powers of 2** (e.g., 1024, 2048, etc.).

> **Note:** Linear Prediction is beneficial when only a few points have been recorded in a dimension, otherwise it may be 
> detrimental might be detrimental and thus must be turned off.

   - Navigate to `PROCPARS -> FOURIER` and set the parameter **ME_mod** to `no` for all dimensions except those that only 
a few points are recorded. In this example only F2 (`C`), which had only `64` points and I quadrupled them.

2. **Initiate NUS-reconstruction with zero phase values:**
  - Execute `FnTYPE`. If this option is **not** set to `non-uniform sampling` then you can safely use `ftnd 0 nusft` or just `ft3d`
instead of `ftnd 0` to skip the NUS-reconstruction in all relevant steps from this point on. But even if you run `ftnd 0`, 
Topspin will recognize it by itself and skip the otherwise tedious NUS-reconstruction. 
  - Select the `cc` method within the **NUS** section of **PROCPARS** window or execute `3 Mdd_mod c`.
  - Execute the command `ftnd 0` for Fourier transformation and NUS reconstruction - it shouldn't last long in the 3D 
spectrum. This step helps in visualizing the spectrum and deciding on the dimensions to truncate.

3. **Extract the 1st FID:**  
  - Open the processed 3D spectrum and run `rser eao 1` to extract the 1st FID followed by `ft` to switch to the 
frequency domain. Note that for other spectra, the `eao` argument may not be appropriate (see Topspins' command manual).
  - **Alternatively**, you can create a **macro** using the command `edmac qfp`.
  - In the editor that opens, write the following commands to save and process the spectrum:
    ```sh
    qsin
    fp
    ```
  - Run the command `qfp`.
  - In the pop-up window, set `1` at `FID` and `2` at `PROCNO`.
  - Issue twice `.gr` to display denser grid lines.

4. **Manual Phase Correction:**  
  - Enter `.ph` for manual phase correction. Set the pivot line (right mouse click) near the right limit end to modify 
only `PHC0`, not `PHC1`.
   > **Note:** Adjusting `PHC1` (1st order correction) has minimal effect on frequencies near the pivot and no effect on `PHC0`.
  - Shift baseline to bottom with `.sd` and adjust its position with the **arrow** icons.
  - Adjust only `PHC0` (0th order correction) so the FID line extends straight and the highest peaks point upwards.  
   > **Note:** Avoid using automatic phasing (`apk` and its variants) as it generally doesn't work well.

7. **Save and Apply PHC0:**  
  - Note down the optimal `PHC0` value (e.g., `151.40` degrees). Click the **Save-disk nD** icon to copy the values to 
the 3D spectrum, then click the **Return icon**. Double-click the processed 3D spectrum and ensure all `PHC0` and 
`PHC1` values except for **F3(PHC0)** are still set to `0`.

8. **Repeat NUS Reconstruction:**  
  - If NUS was used, follow [this tutorial](../NUS_reconstruction/3D.md) to repeat NUS-reconstruction with the correct 
phase angles, otherwise just run `ft3d`.
  - Click on the `23` icon and navigate the F2-F3 plane by holding left-mouse button and dragging your mouse. You will 
notice that there are not dispersion signals in the F3 dimension.

![](images/3D_phased_23_plane.png)

  - Do the same for the **F3-F1 plane** by clicking on the **31** icon. There are plenty of dispersion signals in the 
**F2 dimension**, which means that the spectrum needs additional phasing.

## SOLUTION 2: Phase-Correct the F2-F3 sum projection of the 3D Spectrum.

## Summary of Commands and Steps

1. **Reset all F4 phase values to `0`:**
  - Like in **SOLUTION 1**.

2. **Initiate Fourier Transform with zero phase values:**
  - Like in **SOLUTION 2**.

3. **Create the Sum Projection of F2-F3:**
  - Issue the following command to create the sum projection of F2-F3 (`N-HN`):
```
sumpl 23 all all 23230
```

![](images/3D_unphased_23_sum_projection.png)

  - Switch Back to the 3D Spectrum and the following command to create the sum projection of F1-F3 (`H-HN`):
```
sumpl 13 all all 13130
```

![](images/3D_unphased_13_sum_projection.png)

4. **Visualization and Dimension Truncation:**
  - Open the `23` sum projection. The vertical line in the center represent water signal; the pulse sequences are designed 
to be symmetrical ensuring that the space before and after the water line is the same.
  - Zoom in by selecting the region of interest (RIO).

# I STOPPED HERE

  - Right-click again anywhere on the spectrum and this time select `Save Display Region To -> 
Parameters ABSF1/2 (e.g. used by 'absf, apkf')`. This is to ensure that the baseline correction takes place downfield (to the left)
of the water line (`~4.5 ppm` in `HN`) to avoid filling the spectrum with noise. After this, the boundaries of the ROI 
will appear in `STSR` and `STSI` parameters under the `PROCPARS` tab.
  - Transfer manually these values to the respective parameters of the 3D spectrum.
  - Switch back to the 23 sum projection and issue the following commands:

```
1 ABSF1 1000
1 ABSF2 -1000
1 BC_mod no
2 BC_mod qpol
2 SSB 2.2
2 SI SI*2
1 SI SI*4
```

  - These commands have the following effects:
    - Leave the default `ABSF1` and `ABSF2` values in the `N` dimension.
    - Select the `qpol` polynomial function since `qfil` suppresses water very aggressively and is not recommended for the `N-HN` spectrum.
    - Set `BC_mod` to `no` in the `N` dimension due to its sensitivity to the polynomial.
    - Set the `SSB` of the direct dimension to `2.2` for further resolution.
    - Increase the `SI` size of the direct dimension by 2 times to enhance resolution.
    - Increase the indirect dimension size by four times (zero filling). Ensure that **all SI values are powers of 2** (e.g., 1024, 2048, etc.).

  - Execute `xfb` followed by `abs1` and `abs2` for baseline correction. This will remove the irrelevant HN shift region,
including the water line, while keeping only the ROI. It will also result in sharper and better-resolved peaks due to 
zero filling and increased SSB.

  - Repeat the same procedure for `13` sum projection.

5. **Prepare for Manual Phase Correction in the F2 dimension:**
  - Enter `.ph` for manual phase correction.
  - Look for peaks that have an anti-phase component (signals of dispersion character) in the F2 dimension.
  - Place the cursor between the centers of these two peaks. Ensure the cursor is along the line connecting them. 
  - Right-click and select **"Add"**.

![Add Peak](images/add_peak.png)

  - Try to select peaks that cover the span of the whole spectrum; 4 or 5 peaks should suffice.

![Added Peaks](images/added_peaks.png)

6. **Enter Phase Correction Mode:**
  - Click on the icon with the letter **"R"** to enter phase correction mode for the rows, which correspond to the 
F2 (`HN`) dimension in the `23` sum plane.

7. **Set the Pivot Point:**
  - Right-click at the left limit of the screen and select **"Set Pivot"**.
  - Place the pivot point away from the peaks to avoid hiding the frequencies we want to phase.
  - Note: Only the `PHC0` value will be adjusted, not `PHC1`, so a pivot line is not necessary.

![F2 Before Phasing](images/F2_before_phasing.png)

8. **Adjust the Phase:**
  - Left-button press on the **"0"** icon and drag your mouse until the strongest signals appear at the top part of each panel.
  - Ensure the frequency lines from end to end look straight and balanced.

![F2 After Phasing](images/F2_after_phasing.png)

9. **Save the PHC0 Value:**
  - Click on the **"Save-disk"** icon to save the selected `PHC0` value (e.g., `XXX` degrees) to the `N-HN plane` spectrum.
  - Then click the **Return icon**.

10. **Verify the Phase-Corrected Spectrum:**
  - The phase-corrected spectrum should now appear without any anti-phase peak components.

![Phased 23 sum projection](images/phased_23_plane.png)

11. **Save and Apply PHC0 to 3D:**
  - Note down the optimal `PHC0` value (e.g., `XXX` degrees) and click the **Save-disk nD** icon to copy the values 
to the 2D plane. Then click the **Return icon**.
  - Transfer the `PHC0` and `PHC1` values to the 3D spectrum.
  - Run `ft3d` for FT and phase correction with the values you provided.

12. **Review and Adjust Peaks in 3D View:**
  - Return to the 3D view to review the changes by clicking the **cube** icon.
  - Click on the **/8** icon to display the peaks. Adjust the contour levels with your mouse.
  - Click on the **aim** icon to switch to 2D plane view. Navigate through different 
planes using the **up and down arrows** icon. Identify a plane where peak phases are unsatisfactory.

13. **Extract and Process a Specific Plane:**
  - Execute `slice` to extract the problematic plane.
  - A window will ask for the **plane number** (displayed at the bottom left in red letters). Enter **Destination PROCNO**
with indices corresponding to the selected dimensions, such as `23` for the **F2-F3 plane**.

[IMAGE]

14. **Reconstruct Imaginary Dimension for Further Phase Correction:**
  - Use `xht1` followed by `xht2` or navigate through the menu `Advanced -> Special Transforms -> Hilbert in F1` and 
then `Hilbert in F2` to reconstruct the imaginary dimensions.

> **Note:** Files like `3rrr` represent the spectrum in real space, whereas files such as `3iri`, `3irr`, `3rir`, 
`3iir`, and `3iii` contain at least one imaginary dimension.

  - Repeat **steps 5-14** until you are satisfied with the phases of the **F3** and **F2 dimensions** in the 3D spectrum.
  - Repeat **steps 5-14** for `13` sum projection until you are satisfied with the phases of the **F1 dimension**, too.
  - The optimum phase values I found for this example were `F3(PHC0)=XXX` and `F1(PHC0)=XXX` and the spectrum looks like this:

## Baseline Correction

1. **Increase FID Dimensions:**
  - Increase FID dimensions by x2, maximum x3 (e.g., if the dimension size is 60).

2. **Set Baseline:**
  - `3 BC_mod spol`
  - Choose a baseline where there are no peaks. In the proton dimension, set `ABSF1 -> 9.0 ppm` and `ABSF2 -> -4.0 ppm`.

3. **Fourier Transform:**
  - Perform Fourier transform with `ft3d`.

4. **Contour Level Adjustment:**
  - Click on the "hill" icon, set Contour level sign to positive, Level increment to 1.2, and the number of levels to 30.

5. **Navigate and Adjust Peaks:**
  - Navigate in depth (F2) by clicking the "+" icon until you reach two overlapping peaks.
  - Note down the plane number (e.g., 27/256).
  - Iterate with different FID sizes, window functions, and linear predictions until the peaks separate. Do not apply 
linear prediction on the proton dimension because many points are acquired, but it can be done in the indirect dimension. 
Avoid overdoing it.

6. **Baseline Correction:**
  - Perform baseline correction with the commands:
  ```sh
  tabs1
  tabs3
  ```
  - This corrects the baseline in F1 and F3 dimensions.
