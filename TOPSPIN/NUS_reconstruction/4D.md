Tested environment:
* Topspin 4.4.0 *with commercial license* for NUS processing
* OS: AlmaLinux 9 (as an Oracle virtual machine)
* 20 CPU cores, 120 GB of RAM.

# General workflow

1. Copy the raw 4D spectrum in a new directory by executing `wrpa` command. This will make working with the 4D neat and safe.
> [!NOTE]
> NUS FIDs before reconstruction are not that heavy: the `ser` files are usually <1 Gb. 
2. Switch to the newly copied procedure; Open up the processing parameters (`edp` or the tab `PROCPAR`). 
3. Adjust the size of the dimensions in the final spectrum with the parameter `SI`. **Always set it to a power of 2**. 
For example, if `TD` values under `ACQUPARS` is `160`, then se `SI` to `256` or `512`.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always set the `SI` to the next or higher power of 2, never lower than the respective `TD` value! 
> Otherwise TopSpin behaves weirdly, e.g. will leave indirect dimensions in time domain.
4. If there were recorded test 2D **planes** (or 3D cubes) with **this exact** 4D pulse program, check their processing parameters:
    * Phasing in the direct and indirect dimensions
    * Window functions (rarely changes from default)
    * Baseline correction parameters (rarely changes from default)
    * Linear Prediction (**LP**), if you use it.
> [!TIP]
> **NUS and LP should not be combined.** NUS simulates fitfully the whole FID, while LP simulates 
> the FID decay that was truncated out. As such, NUS reconstruction substitutes LP and LP must not be applied to any 
> spectrum (4D, 3D) recorded with NUS.
> If recorderd without NUS, Using LP can enhance resolution, especially if the time domain (TD) values are small or if your 
> FIDs are truncated. In TopSpin, you can use LP for improving resolution in particular dimensions during the Fourier 
> Transform process by specifying the `ME_mod` and `NCOEF` parameters for those dimensions. Note that it may cause 
> additional wiggles.

![processing_parameters_window_bottom](../../Non_Uniform_Sampling/images/processing_parameters_2.png)
5. Set the `FnMODE` according to the acquisition mode (usually the `N` dimension is `echo-antiecho` and the rest `States-TPPI`)
6. Note down the signal region in the direct dimension. It can be extracted either from the test planes or the 2D experiments (HSQC, TOCSY, etc). 
    * Go to the 2D experiment. Zoom in such that the signal-free regions are trimmed as much as possible. Issue the `.ftf2region STSR` command, it will prompt to  `Save display region to Parameters STSR\SI`.
    * Issue the `STSR` command. Note down the values for the direct dimension. Same with `STSI`
> [!TIP]
> Those values may be obtained manually: in the 1D or 2D spectrum, note the "col Index" (`16` on the screenshot). Save 
it into `STSR`. Move the coursor to the right and calculate the width of the dimension in points, save that number into `STSI`.   

![coursor_position](../../Non_Uniform_Sampling/images/coursor_position.png)
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you copy the FT region from the planes, make sure the spectrum windows (SW) of the 4D and the test planes are the same. If they are not, the signal regions have to be adjusted manually. 
7. Go to the `NUS` section. Set the NUS mode to `cs`. Set the phasing of the indirect dimensions to the same values as in the `Phase` section (i.e. `PH0` and `PH1`). 
8. For the CS reconstructions in Topspin, it’s a good idea to increase the number of iterations. Since 4D spectra have 
a high dynamic range, weaker peaks are typically reconstructed in later iterations. The default setting of 
`Mdd_CsNITER 200` (hidden parameter) in Topspin could be increased to `Mdd_CsNITER 400` or `Mdd_CsNITER 600` for better
results. However, this should be tested case by case. While you may be tempted to go up to 1000 iterations, this is 
likely unnecessary.
9. When everything is ready, issue 

    `ftnd 0 nusthreads 16`

* `ftnd` will run the NUS reconstruction, followed by FT all directions, with the Window Multiplication (WM) and 
baseline correction as specified in the PROCPARS. `0` stands for "all dimensions",  `nusthreads 16` allocates 16 CPU 
cores for the process (Topspin's limit). 
> [!NOTE]
> Whereas NUS reconstruction is parallelized, FT stage uses only a single thread, therefore takes multiple hours.
9. *Optionally*: adjust baseline correction parameters and apply the automatic baseline correction to the whole reconstructed 4D spectrum by issuing `absnd`.
10. Evaluate the quality of the reconstructed spectrum by looking at the sum projections. You need to look at both positive and negative projections to identify the antiphase signals as well as the potentially misphased peaks. This is done by the command `projplp` and `projpln`. Run each and provide the parameters over the GUI or run the single lines such as `projplp 12 all all 12` 
    - `projplp` stands for positive projection; run `projpln` to get the negative one
    - `12` refers to keeping the first two dimensions (for standard Bruker HSQC NOESY, those are C and HC dimensions); that means, N (F3) and direct H (F4) will be summed up.
    - `all` indicates that all planes within these dimensions should be included.
    - `12` specifies the output PROCNO where the projection data will be stored. Adjust the PROCNO based on where you want to save the output.
11. Perform automatic baseline correction of the projections with `abs1` followed by `abs2`.
12. If the projections look good, evaluate the 4D spectrum. 
    * Perform a putative peak picking. For that, lower the countours such that the noise disappears, then issue `pp` and set the sensitivity to the lowest countour level. 
    
    ![alt text](../../Non_Uniform_Sampling/images/peak_picking.png)
    * Jump to some position of the 4D which contains signals. For that, press the E button and give the plane numbers or the desired ppm.

    ![screenshot](../../Non_Uniform_Sampling/images/navigation_4D.png)

13. If the phasing or other processing parameters are off, adjust them and repeat the NUS reconstruction. If the 
projections look good - congratulations!

## Troubleshooting 

### Post-reconstruction phasing
If the spectrum appears to be misphased, it has to be processed all over again. To determine the optimal phasing angles:


### The reconstructed spectrum is left in the time domain
* Run `ftnd 3`, `ftnd 2` and `ftnd 1` to reconstruct the dimensions one by one. 
  * This should not initiate NUS reconstruction, at least on the machines without the NUS license.

@Katja: THIS IS NOT NECESSARY FOR TOPSPIN; IS IT? Instead, THE PHASING SHOULD TAKE CARE OF IT?
<------->
### Processing steps

1. **Correct 1-Point Delay in 13C:**
    - Create a new nuslist with a 1-point shift in the 13C axis and replace the original nuslist:
      ```sh
      awk '{print $1,$2+1,$3}' nuslist > nuslist.off
      mv nuslist nuslist.back
      mv nuslist.off nuslist
      ```
    - Extend the 13C axis in Topspin by 1 complex point by changing static param NusTD(F2) from `160` (`TD(F2)` in your `ACQPARS`) to `162` (`TD(F2)+2`):
      ```sh
      2s NusTD 162
      ```
      Verify that `162` was saved in the file: `grep "NusTD" acqu3s`

      This should automatically set static TDeff(F2) also to `162` and allow processing with the adjusted nuslist.

2. **Set Main Processing Parameters (`edp`):**

   |   | F4           |F3 |F2 |F1 |
   |---|--------------|---|---|---|
   |SI| 1024         |256|256|512|

   |PHC1| 0            |0|0  |0  |
   |PH mod| pk           |pk|pk|pk |
   |BC_mod| qfil or qpol |no|no|no|
   |STSR| 55           |0|0|0|
   |SRSI| 350          |0|0|0|
   |FCOR| 0.5          |0.5|0.5|0.5|

   |MddF180|              |false|false|false|
   |MdPHASE|              |0|0|0|

Optionally increase the number of iterations with `Mdd_CsNITER 600`.

  - MDD_CsVE: `true`

3. **Process 4D Spectrum:** 
`ftnd 0`

4. *Optional* **Baseline Correction in F4**: 
`absnd 4`

5. **Correct Known TopSpin Bug (Badly Written CAR)** + Correct Shift by 1/4*SW in 13C:**
    - **CAR of HC Axis:** Written as 6.666 ppm, but should be 4.7 ppm
      - Total shift of HC(F1) axis:
        - In Topspin: Set SR(F1) to (6.666-4.7)*600.05 = 1179.698 Hz
          or
        - In POKY: Set HC shift in "st" to -(6.666-4.7) = -1.966 ppm
    - **CAR of 13C Axis:** Written as 39.1096 ppm, but should be 41 ppm. 13C axis is folded by 1/4*SW, relevant peaks are aliased.
      - Total shift of 13C(F2) axis:
        - In Topspin: Set SR(F2) to (58.0333/4 + (41-39.1096))*150.882693 = 2474.283 Hz
          or
        - In POKY: Set 13C shift in "st" to -(58.0333/4 + (41-39.1096)) = -16.398 ppm
6. Pick the most intense peaks with `pp` interface
7. Make the projections:
   * `projplp 34 all all 43`
   * `projpln 34 all all 430`
   * `projplp 24 all all 42`
   * `projpln 24 all all 420`
   * `projplp 14 all all 41`

## Frank Lohr's implementation of 4D HCCH SOFAST-HMQC-NOESY-HSQC experiment `sfhmqc_noe_sfhmqc_4Dhcch.fl`

The test protein is HSP90 (30 kDa) measured on the 850 MHz spectrometer.

This spectrum is larger than the 4D HCNH, so it's crucial to carefully define the strip fit values, specifically 
the parameters `STSR` and `STSI`. To set these, overlay the individual planes measured without NUS onto the 13C HSQC spectrum, 
adjust the chemical shift referencing if needed to align the planes with the 13C HSQC peaks, and zoom in the region 
containing peaks in the 2D planes. Right-click and save the display region to parameters `STSR` and `STSI` for strip fitting. 

Below, I provide the optimum values for this example spectrum, but you’ll need to determine them yourself for your case. 
Note that even with restricted strip fitting, the NUS reconstruction will take much longer than for an 4D HCNH spectrum, 
consume more memory, and the final *4rrrr* file will likely be larger, so choose the `STSR` and `STSI` values carefully.

# [Miscellaneous Cases](./Miscennaleous_Cases.md)

* If you set the `STSI` > 0 in dimensions F3, F2, or F1, e.g. 341 in *F3*, you will get the following message:

According to processing-reference.pdf, in 4D, the processing parameter STSI is rounded up to the next multiple of 16. 
Since I set STSI to 341, it was adjusted to 352. The weird message I described is likely safe and can be ignored. However, the 4rrrr file size remains an issue that needs to be addressed.
