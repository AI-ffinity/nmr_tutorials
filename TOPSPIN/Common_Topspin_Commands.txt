### Spectra Processing Commands:
* **`xfb`** - Process data in F1 and F2 dimensions, transferring FID to a 2D spectrum.
* **`clev 0.6 32`** - Automatically calculate and set contour levels for 2D data; 0.6 is the factor for calculation and 32 is the number of levels.
* **`.ph`** - Enter phase mode for adjusting the phase of the spectrum.
* **`abs1`** - Perform automatic baseline correction in the F1 axis.
* **`abs2`** - Perform automatic baseline correction in the F2 axis.
* **`edp`** - Open the "PROCPARS" interface.
* **`ft3d n`** - Process 3D data including Fourier Transform, without creating an imaginary file (only 3rrr file in pdata folder).
* **`tabs3`, `tabs2`, `tabs1`** - Perform baseline correction in the F3, F2, and F1 axes, respectively.
* **`ftnd 0 nusft`** - Execute Fourier transformation without NUS reconstruction.
* **`SI/2`** - Command to halve the Size Increment in the STSI field.
* **`3 TDeff 1400`** - Set the effective time domain size for the direct dimension.
* **`edmac qfp`** - Create a new macro named qfp.
* **`qsin`** - Apply a quadrature sine window function.
* **`fp`** - Perform Fourier transformation (likely ft with parameters).
* **`qfp`** - Run the macro named qfp.
* **`.gr`** - Refresh the graphical display.
* **`ftnd 0`** - Execute NUS reconstruction with Fourier transformation.
* **`slice`** - Extract a specific plane from multidimensional data.
* **`xht1`** - Command to reconstruct the imaginary dimension in F1.
* **`xht2`** - Command to reconstruct the imaginary dimension in F2.
* **`projplp 34 all all 34`** and **`projplp 21 all all 21`** - Generates positive projections of the specified dimensions for visualization.
* **`projpln 12 all 11239122`** - Generates the Negative Projection for specified dimensions.

### Display adjustments
* **`dlp`** - Save the currently displayed region as default for this processed data
* **`.lv` or `edlev`** - Manually enter contour levels mode to adjust "level increment" and "number of levels".

### Spectrometer Control and Spectra Recording Commands:
* **`sx`** and **`ej`** - Commands used to eject the current sample from the spectrometer.
* **`sx <position>`** - Starts the carousel and inserts the sample at the specified position into the spectrometer.
* **`new`** - Creates a new experiment based on an active one.
* **`ww`** - Executes automatic matching and tuning of the system.
* **`lock`** - Locks the magnetic field, usually selecting "H2O + D2O" from the dropdown list.
* **`topshim gui`** - Initiates automatic 1D shimming to optimize the magnetic field homogeneity.
* **`p1` followed by `1 P1 1`** - Configures pulse program settings.
* **`zg`** - Starts the experiment, initiating the acquisition of the NMR spectrum.
* **`atma`** - Automatically tunes and matches the channels, typically used for 15N and 1H channels.
* **`pulsecal`** - Calculates the length of the 90Â° hydrogen pulse P1 for 10W.
* **`getprosol 1H P1 xW`** - Sets pulse and power, inserting previously determined value P1 with the appropriate power value.
* **`stop`** - Stops the measurement process.
* **`pulse <x>W`** - Recalculates the pulse for `<x> Watt`.
