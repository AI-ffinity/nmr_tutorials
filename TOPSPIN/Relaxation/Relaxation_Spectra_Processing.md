The relaxation data are signal intensities at pre-specified time points plotted together.
T2 relaxation is more sensitive to the MW and therefore more informative.
From this data we obtain primarily two types of information:
1) If the protein forms aggregates or multimers then the MW of the complex increases, the tumbling rate drops, and the T2 
relaxation of its nuclei shortens (faster relaxation), which results to signal drop.
2) On the opposite, if the protein unfolds or is degraded (is broken down to smaller parts), then the tumbling rate
increases, the T2 relaxation of its nuclei increases (slower relaxation), which results to signal increase.
