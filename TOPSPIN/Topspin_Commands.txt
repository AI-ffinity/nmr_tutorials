2D Spectrum Processing Commands:
xfb - Process data in F1 and F2 dimensions, transferring FID to a 2D spectrum.
clev 0.6 32 - Automatically calculate and set contour levels for 2D data; 0.6 is the factor for calculation and 32 is the number of levels.
.lv or edlev - Manually enter contour levels mode to adjust "level increment" and "number of levels".
.ph - Enter phase mode for adjusting the phase of the spectrum.
abs1 - Perform automatic baseline correction in the F1 axis.
abs2 - Perform automatic baseline correction in the F2 axis.
3D Spectrum Processing Commands:
edp - Used to access and modify processing parameters in the "ProcPars" window.
ft3d n - Process 3D data including Fourier Transform, without creating an imaginary file (only 3rrr file in pdata folder).
tabs3, tabs2, tabs1 - Perform baseline correction in the F3, F2, and F1 axes, respectively.
General Commands:
edp - Also mentioned in the context of setting calibration values and checking various parameters like PHC0, PHC1, ABSF1, ABSF2, etc.
These commands are typical of TopSpin operations for higher-dimensional NMR data processing and are critical for the successful transformation, correction, and visualization of NMR spectra. Each command has specific roles and settings that are used to optimize the resulting NMR data for analysis.

   - Generates positive projections of the specified dimensions for visualization.

6. **`.md`**
   - Command used to overlay spectra or possibly manage macros/display settings in TopSpin, though its specific context here might refer to a macro or script usage.
   
 

### Fourier Transform and Baseline Correction
1. **`ft`**
   - Performs a one-dimensional Fourier Transform on the data.
2. **`fp`**
   - Alias for performing a Fourier Transform.
3. **`ef`**
   - Alias for performing an exponential Fourier Transform.
4. **`efp`**
   - Performs an exponential Fourier Transform followed by phase correction.
5. **`qfp`**
   - Applies a quadrature sine bell window function, performs a Fourier Transform, and then phase correction.
6. **`xfb`**
   - Executes a Fourier Transform on both dimensions of a 2D dataset. Variants include `xfb n`, `xf2`, and `xf1` to focus on specific dimensions or to discard imaginary data.
7. **`abs`**
   - Performs baseline correction. The parameters `absf1` & `absf2` specify the range in ppm for the correction.
8. **`abs2`**
   - Baseline correction specifically for the F2 dimension of a 2D spectrum.
9. **`abs1`**
   - Baseline correction specifically for the F1 dimension of a 2D spectrum.

### Phase Correction
10. **`.ph`**
    - Enters interactive phase correction mode.
11. **`pk`**
    - Applies previously set phase corrections (`phc0` and `phc1`) to the spectrum.
12. **`apk`**
    - Executes automated phase correction, suitable for simple spectra like methanol.

### Window Functions
13. **`em`**
    - Applies exponential multiplication to the data, used for line broadening.
14. **`sin`**
    - Multiplies the data by a sine window, phase-shifted by Ï€/ssb.
15. **`qsin`**
    - Multiplies the data by a quadrature sine window, similar to `sin` but typically with different phase adjustments.

### Miscellaneous Processing
16. **`eda`**
    - Displays parameters for the indirect dimensions of 2D, 3D spectra such as sweep width, time domain size, and offsets.
17. **`tf3 n; tf2 n; tf1 n`**
    - Fourier Transforms the specified dimension in a 3D dataset. The 'n' indicates that no imaginary data is generated.
