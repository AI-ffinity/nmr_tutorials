# Removal of Glycerol

The purpose of this tutorial is to describe the procedure of removal of the glycerol that is present in the protein samples for their stabilization, but interfere with the NMR measurements. The equipment needed to for this is listed below:

- Fixed angle rotor
- Pipettes (ideally of range 100 and 200 μl) 
- 0.5 mL centrifugal filter unit 10 (3 – 10 kDa MWCO), inserted into bigger Eppendorf vial
- NanoDrop equipment for measuring the concentration (described in a separate tutorial)
- NMR buffer (without glycerol): 25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, pH 7.5
- Shigemi tubes
- D2O solution
- Protein aliquotes
- Box filled with ice

## 1. Preparation of the filter units (Wetting of the membrane)

This step is conducted in order to pre-wash the membrane of the filter with the NMR buffer. It consists of these tasks:

 - a) Transfer 400 μl of the NMR buffer into the filter unit.
 - b) Load the unit with the buffer into the angle rotor.
 - c) Start the rotor with these conditions already pre-set: 10g rotation, 40 minutes, 4°C
 - d) After the spinning is concluded, discard the filtrate

 ## 2. Buffer exchange cycles

 In this step, the glycerol is being removed from the protein samples. The removal is happening due to the design of the membrane,
 which allows small molecules (such as glycerol) to pass through, whereas the bigger molecules (proteins) are kept within the filter unit.
 Therefore, after each cycle, one will end up the with the filtered protein (retenate) inside the filter unit, whereas the filtered glycerol (filtrate) will end up in the bigger Eppendorf vial.

 The first cycle consists of these tasks:

- a) Thaw all 3 protein aliquotes on ice. Each aliquote is holding a 100 μl of protein solution.
- b) Tranfer all of the aliquotes (300 μl in total) into the pre-wet filter unit.
- c) Top up the filter unit holding the aliquotes with 200 μl of the NMR buffer.
- d) Transfer the unit into the angle rotor and spin with the same conditions as listed in the first step (10g, 40 minutes, 4°C)
- e) Discard the filtrate and mix the resulting retenate inside the unit gently.
- f) Record the volume of the retenate.

After the first cycle is completed, follow these steps two times:

- a) Bring the volume of the retenate from the previous cycle again up to 500 μl with the NMR buffer.
- b) Mix thoroughly by gentle pipetting in and out.
- c) Spin at the same conditons as previously, the resulting retenate volume should be ~120 μl.
- d) Discard the filtrate and mix the resulting retenate inside the unit gently.
- f) Record the volume of the retenate.

After these three cycles, the glycerol content will be reduced to a level which is negligible for NMR. 

> **_NOTE:_**  After each exchange cycle, there will be some inevitable losses of protein.

# 3. Check of the final concentration of the protein

In this step, one will find out the final concentration of the protein after the 3 exchange cycles. It consists of these steps:

- a) Dilute the retenate (the result of the third exchange) to 300 μl with the NMR buffer and mix well.
- b) Transfer the resulting sample and NMR buffer into the box filled with ice.
- c) Take the box to the place where the NanoDrop equipment is and follow the steps described in the NanoDrop tutorial.
- d) After the concentration is measured, divide the number by 1.079 (absorption coefficient) to find out the final concentration of sample ready for NMR measurement.
