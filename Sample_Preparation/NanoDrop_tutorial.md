# Measurement of Protein Concetration with NanoDrop Spectrophotometer

The NanoDrop spectrophotometer uses **surface tension** to hold small liquid samples in place, eliminating the need for cuvettes or capillaries. It operates based on **UV/Vis spectroscopy**, measuring light absorbance at specific wavelengths.

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for measuring protein concentration at **280 nm**.

### Equipment (available at the NanoDrop station):

- NanoDrop spectrophotometer (connected to a computer with NanoDrop GUI)
- Milli-Q detergent (for cleaning the measurement surfaces)
- Pipette set to 3 μL (the required sample volume)
- Wiping tissues

### User-provided materials:

- NMR buffer (for blanking)
- Protein sample

## 1. Measurement Procedure

Follow these steps to perform the measurement:

- a) Open the spectrophotometer lid.
- b) Pipette 3 μL of Milli-Q detergent onto the lower measurement tip, close the lid, then wipe both the **top and bottom tips** thoroughly.
- c) In the NanoDrop GUI, select **`Protein A280`** to use the correct settings for protein absorbance at 280 nm.
- d) Pipette 3 μL of the NMR buffer onto the lower tip.
- e) Click **`Blank Measurement`** in the GUI.
- f) Close the lid and wait for the blanking process to complete.
- g) Reopen the lid and **wipe both tips thoroughly** using a tissue.
- h) Pipette 3 μL of the **protein sample** onto the lower tip.
- i) Click the **`Measure`** button in the GUI (it may also be labeled `Protein`).
- j) Close the lid and wait for the measurement to complete.
- k) Divide the reported concentration by **1.079** (the absorption coefficient) to calculate the correct molar concentration. Record the result.
- l) Return the GUI to the **Home** screen.
- m) Pipette 3 μL of Milli-Q detergent onto the lower tip again, close the lid briefly, then wipe both tips clean for storage.

> **_TIP:_** Always ensure the measuring surfaces are clean before and after each measurement to avoid cross-contamination or inaccurate readings.
