# Measurement of Protein Concentration with NanoDrop Spectrophotometer

The NanoDrop spectrophotometer uses **surface tension** to hold small liquid samples in place, eliminating the need for cuvettes or capillaries. It operates based on **UV/Vis spectroscopy**, measuring light absorbance at specific wavelengths.

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for measuring protein concentration at **280 nm**. To do so accurately, you must also know the **extinction coefficient** and **molecular weight** of the measured protein, which can be obtained using the **ProtParam** tool.

## üì¶ Equipment (available at the NanoDrop station)

- NanoDrop spectrophotometer (with NanoDrop GUI)
- Milli-Q detergent (for cleaning)
- Pipettes (1‚Äì20 ŒºL range)
- Wiping tissues

## üß™ User-Provided Materials

- NMR buffer (for blanking)
- Protein sample
- Extinction coefficient and molecular weight (from ProtParam)

---

## 1. Obtaining the Extinction Coefficient via ProtParam

1. Visit [ProtParam](https://web.expasy.org/protparam/)
2. Paste your protein's FASTA sequence
3. Click `Compute Parameters`
4. Locate the **Extinction Coefficient** section
5. ‚úÖ **If your buffer contains reducing agents (e.g., DTT or TCEP)**, choose the value assuming all Cys are **reduced**

## 2. Preparation of Samples for Measurement

Before performing NanoDrop measurements, the protein solution must be diluted to ensure that the absorbance at 280 nm (**A280**) falls within the linear range of the Beer‚ÄìLambert law, typically **between 0.1 and 1.0**.

Because the stock concentration is often unknown, begin with a test dilution and increase if necessary. Once you determine the correct dilution factor, prepare a triplicate set for accurate measurement.

### üìê Useful Equations

```txt
Dilution factor = (sample volume + buffer volume) / sample volume  
Total dilution = dilution_1 √ó dilution_2 √ó ...
c [ŒºM] = (A √ó 10‚Å∂ √ó dilution) / Œµ  
c [ŒºM] = (mg/mL √ó 10‚Å∂ √ó dilution) / MW
```

### üî¨ Step 1: Prepare a 20√ó Test Dilution Sample

- 2 ŒºL protein + 38 ŒºL buffer ‚Üí total = 40 ŒºL  
- Dilution = **20√ó**  
- Vortex thoroughly

---

### üß™ Step 2: Measure A280

- Measure **3 ŒºL** on NanoDrop
- If **A280 < 1.0**, proceed to replicate measurements
- If **A280 > 1.0**, dilute further:

| Final Dilution | Dilution Step | Test Dilution Sample | Buffer | Total Vol |
|----------------|----------------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 30√ó            | 1.5√ó           | 6 ŒºL   | 3 ŒºL   | 9 ŒºL      |
| 40√ó            | 2√ó             | 5 ŒºL   | 5 ŒºL   | 10 ŒºL     |
| 50√ó            | 2.5√ó           | 4 ŒºL   | 6 ŒºL   | 10 ŒºL     |

> üí° Example: 20√ó ‚Üí 2√ó ‚Üí 40√ó total dilution

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Prepare Final Replicates

- Once the correct dilution is identified, prepare **3 replicates**
  - Each should yield at least **15 ŒºL** (5 √ó 3 ŒºL measurements)
- ‚úÖ If the initial 20√ó test is valid, you can use it as **Replicate 1**

---

## 3. Measurement Procedure

1. Clean both tips:
   - Load 3 ŒºL Milli-Q
   - Close lid briefly
   - Wipe both tips

2. Open NanoDrop software
   - Select **"Protein A280"**

3. Under `Type`, choose:
   - ‚úÖ **"Other protein (E & MW)"**
     - Enter **Œµ** from ProtParam (in thousands, e.g., 21 for 21,000)
     - Enter **MW** in kDa

4. Blank:
   - Load **3 ŒºL NMR buffer**
   - **Close lid**, click **Blank**

5. Measure sample:
   - Wipe tips
   - Load **3 ŒºL protein sample**
   - **Close lid**, click **Measure**

6. Record results:
   - A280
   - mg/mL value reported by NanoDrop

> üßº Only clean with Mili-Q and return to the homescreen **after final replicate**, not between every measurement

## 4. Calculating Protein Concentration

After measurement, you can calculate protein concentration using either of the following methods:

> üß† Best Practice: Record **both A280 and mg/mL** for cross-checking

---

### üîπ Method 1: Using Absorbance (A280)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è NanoDrop standardizes all readings to a **1 cm path length**, so `l = 1`

- Calculate the average Absorbance over one replicate, and use:

```math
c [ŒºM] = \frac{(A_{avg} √ó 10^6 √ó dilution)}{Œµ}
```
**Example:**  
- A = 0.750  
- Œµ = 21,000  
- dilution = 30√ó

```
c = (0.750 √ó 10‚Å∂ √ó 30) / 21,000  
  = 22,500,000 / 21,000  
  = 1,071.4 ŒºM
```

---

### üîπ Method 2: Using mg/mL from NanoDrop

```txt
c [ŒºM] = (mg/mL √ó 10‚Å∂ √ó dilution) / MW
```

**Example:**  
- mg/mL = 0.85  
- MW = 71,000  
- dilution = 30√ó

```
[ŒºM] = (0.85 √ó 10‚Å∂ √ó 30) / 71,000  
     = 25,500,000 / 71,000  
     = 359.2 ŒºM
```

---

### üìä Final Reporting

- Average the **three replicate concentrations**
- Optionally report **standard deviation**
- Report final result in **ŒºM**

---

## üß† Tips & Best Practices

- Always mix dilutions thoroughly
- Do not rely on ‚Äú1 Abs = 1 mg/mL‚Äù mode
- Clean tips carefully ‚Äî but only do a full reset after the full triplicate
- Use both A280 and mg/mL values when possible
- Never forget to apply the **dilution factor**
