# Chemical Shift Perturbation Analysis from 15N HSQC Titration Experiments

1. `fm` to open multiple spectra.
2. `ja` save project as..
3. `js` save project
4. `pf` preferences setting => set automatic saving
5. `ct` contour levels one spectrum
6. `zi`, `zo`, `zf`, `zp`: zoom (in, out, show the whole spectrum, previous). Typically type `zf`, then click F11,
 select and focus to the region of interest and click F1 to switch to selection mode.
7. `xa` to display nucleus name (can be also set in `vt`)
8. `rp` to read peak list
9. `ec` (easy contour) changes the contour level of all opened spectra.
10. `eo` easy overlay overlays multiple spectra onto one.
11. `np` create chemical shift perturbation plots.

### Handwritten Notes:
- "Go through peaks and observe the changes. Note down affected residues."
- "Select a peak on the overly window with LMB (left mouse button). C+O (Command + Option) to copy the peak label."
- "My notes: the <up HM?> window and 'op' (comment- paste) to copy the peak label."
- "(bas) Baseline correction, peak is the baseline, where is any speculation which is simplified. not related to
field homogeneity. NE sd this because automatic carrying was imperfect"
