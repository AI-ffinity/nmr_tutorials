Overview
=================

POKY and NMRFAM-Sparky are both developed by [Woongee Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/woongheelee), currently an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at the University of Colorado Denver. POKY is the direct successor of Sparky; therefore, *the user interfaces are very similar, and the absolute majority of the commands in Sparky are the same in POKY* (as of Sep 2024). However, whereas NMRFAM Sparky is no longer supported, POKY continues to evolve and may diverge from the SPARKY interface in the future. Even now, POKY offers significant improvements to the GUI.

Unlike SPARKY, POKY requires an academic or commercial license.
