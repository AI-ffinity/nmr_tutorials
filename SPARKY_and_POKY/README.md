Overview
=================

POKY and NMRFAM-Sparky are both developeed by [Woongee Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/woongheelee), currently an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at University of Colorado Denver. POKY is the direct successor of Sparky, therefore *the user interfaces are very similar, and the abosolute majority of the commands in Sparky are the same in POKY.* (as of Sep, 2024). However, whereas NRFAM Sparky is no longer supported, POKY will keep developing and might diverge from SPARKY interface in the future. Already now, POKY offers significant improvements of the GUI. 

Unlike SPARKY, POKY requires an academic or commercial license.
