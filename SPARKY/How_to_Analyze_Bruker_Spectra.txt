cd into your NMR data dir and do "find . -name 2rr". This will give you all the 2D spectra file paths (TOCSY,ROESY,NOESY). Then load them into Sparky.
Optionally you can convert them to Sparky format using "bruk2ucsf 2rr TOCSY.ucsf" (why ???)

Specific View options of each spectrum can be accessed by the shortcut vt or View -> View options. The menu can also be accessed by right-clicking inside the spectrum.

Pointer mode menu (F1-F12) will open by default, but can also be started by selecting "View"->"Pointer modes" in main sparky window.

To select peaks click F8.

Contour levels can be adjusted with ct shortcut (recommended instead of opening Contour Scale "vC"). Increase the "Lowest" column to weaken the signals and lower to increase
them. (Default value is 1.01e+05).
"Lowest" - lowest contour shown
"Levels" - number of contours to show
"Factor" - multiplication factor determining level of the next contour as "Prev. Level"*"Factor" 


"xa" to display axis atom names (e.g. 1H-1H).

You can show more than one view of a spectrum. Select "duplicate" under the view menu or type the accelerator "vd" in the window you want to duplicate. You can adjust its contour levels and the region shown to be different from the original view. Each view has the name of the original spectrum with a number appended. 
To delete a window use the Delete View command under the View menu (accelerator vD) or click on the close button on the window frame.

If you want to move a peak marker switch to the "select" pointer mode and drag and drop the peaks. If you want to delete a peak switch to select mode, click on a single peak or drag a box around a region to select peaks. Selected peaks are outlined with a square. You can delete the selected peaks by pressing the delete key. If you delete some peaks by mistake you can use the "edit undo" command (accelerator eu) to restore them. This will only undo the most recent peak deletion, peak integration.
To avoid unselecting the currently selected peaks, hold the shift key while pressing the left mouse button. Pressing the shift key and clicking on a selected peak will deselect it without deselecting other selected peaks.
How does Sparky pick peaks? It uses a minimum height and optionally minimum linewidth and minimum drop off filters. The minimum positive and negative heights are equal to the lowest positive and negative contour levels. You set the minimum linewidth using the peak pick dialog (accelerator "kt"). The linewidth is taken as the half height width. To avoid picking overlapped peaks you can insist that the data height drop as you move from the center peak position by a specified amount before rising again. This parameter is also set with the peak pick dialog (kt) and is named "Minimum drop off factor". Recommended values: w1=w2=0, mdof=0.1-0.8 

There are commands to select specific groups of peaks in the currently selected spectrum.
All peaks	pa
Fully assigned	pF
Partially assigned	pP
Unassigned	pN
Select peaks by color	pC
Invert peak selection	pI
Aliased peaks	pA
Intra-residue assignments	pR
Sequential assignments	pS
Medium range assignments	pM
Long range assignments	pL

The select peaks by color command finds all peaks of the same color as a currently selected peak. Sequential assignments means i to i+1. Medium range assignments are i to i+2, i+3,
or i+4. Long range assignments connect atoms 5 or more residues apart. All of the selection commands except select peaks by color unselects all previously selected peaks. 


Select a peak, which you want to label, type "at". A window prompting you to enter residue and atom assignment will show up. It will also select you the closest atom in ppm. If
this is OK double click on it and the first section (w1) will be filled atuomatically. If not type in appropriate names and click 'Ok'. Do that for the 2nd section (w2) too. If you
don't want to assign residue - just leave those fields blank (in that case peak label will contain ? mark). Now a peak label should appear.

You can copy peaks with their assignments between spectra. You select the peaks, use the ornament copy command (oc), select the spectrum window to copy to, and use ornament
paste (op). For copying peaks across the diagonal of a homonuclear 2D spectrum select the peaks to be copied and use the crossdiagonal ornament copy command oX.

Peak assignments are stored in .save files. Make sure to save your spectrum. 
To adjust the size of assignment labels (label font size) on contour plots you use the ornament size dialog in Sparky (oz).

You can overlay the contours of one spectrum on another spectrum. First make sure that the axes have the same name in both spectra. If not, then rename them using the command line tool ucsfdata and the argument -aN. You use the overlay dialog (accelerator ol) to set this up. You choose two Sparky views, one to be shown overlaid on the other. By repeating this process you can overlay as many spectra as you want on one view. You can control the contour levels and colors of each overlaid view separately using the contour dialog (accelerator ct). Printed output does not include the overlaid contours.

You can print contour plots to a Postscript printer with command pt. Only postscript output is available. Color output is supported. Use the Save button to save the postscript to a file. The Preview button is available only on systems that have a postscript previewer. The path to the previewer program must be set in the bin/sparky startup script.

* Try to find some specific residues like Threonine, Serine, Alanine or Glycine; check the chemical shift statistics (shift.tcl). These residues can be used as starting point for your assignments.

Sparky allows plotting 2D planes of NMR spectra to precise dimensions in the PostScript output format. Plotting tool command it pt. Once typed, a dialog (shown below) will open.

1D traces are views of a spectrum obtained from multi-dimensional data along some straight line in the data matrix. Sparky allows viewing those traces if user types vS command (view slices). To remove 1D traces type vS again. 
vS mode can be used to check quality of data fitting. Note that there are more traces in the figure than you might expect. In each panel there is a noisy black spectrum - which is the actual data trace and a much smoother blue line. Traces shown in color other than black (e.g. blue) are those obtained from fitted peak intensities (obtained by pi - peak integrate - tool).
Overlapped peaks can be simultaneously fit where all selected peaks within the lowest contour line are taken as a group. Groups can also include peaks not withing a common contour line but within a specified distance of each other. You can also integrate peaks by boxing or ellipsing. You drag a rectangle or ellipse around a peak and the heights at all interior points are summed up. The integration technique is chosen using the integration dialog (accelerator it). 
To see the numerical volumes and linewidths bring up a peak list (accelerator lt). Press the Options button in the peak list dialog and select volume and linewidth display and press OK. The list shows all peaks in the spectrum and can be written to a file by pressing the Save button. You can also delete rubish peaks by selecting them and clicking the "delete" button of you keyboard.
To load a peak list file press rl and click on "Load...".

When you are working with many views the screen gets crowded. To hide views use "view hide" (vh). To bring them back select them by name from the View menu. You can also use the View menu to raise views that are buried behind other windows to the surface. Another way to show hidden views is to use the project view list (pv). You can also iconify views by clicking on the "iconify" button on the window frame next to the "maximize" button in the upper right corner.


** Tips for resonance assignment **

Print out the molecular structures of all 20 Amino Acids before starting to assign.

Look for unique or easily identifiable spin systems (with few protons) such as Glycine, Alanine, Threonine, Valine, etc. and use any of these residues as starting points for sequential assignments. Then look for Asp (especially its 2 HB at ~2.7 ppm)
Prolines can be identified by lack of HN spin systems in the TOCSY fingerprint region. Additionally, the X-Pro peptide bond mostly adopts a trans conformation that leads to strong NOEs between the Pro-H and the H proton of the preceding residue (X).

Try to use both sequential assignment (Wuthrich) and MCD approach to assign: Try to identify the spin system in TOCSY fingerprint if possible, if not identify the NAB unit and then link them using the NOESY data. During the sequential assignment process look for characteristic NOEs indicative of regular secondary structure.

The peaks of the protons (e.g. HN and CA) of some residues may overlap, which make the spectrum confusing. To find where HN proton peaks overlap integrate the HN peak of residue that you are sure about its position in 1D. Then integrate the position of the putatively overlaped peaks in the 1D spectrum. If the volume is about 2x the volume of the single peak then you are sure that you have a double peak at that position. The integration of 1D spectrum peaks can be done in Topspin.

2D and 1D proton specta may contain peaks that look like aminoacids but they are not. You can discriminate them in 1D from the separation of peaks (usually occurs as a singlet) and in the 2D because they don't have traces of NOE peaks on the vertical line passing through their HN peak.

If you cannot assign any more spectra use the sequential interresidue NOE assignment. Start with the NOEs between HAi and HNi+1. If you still cannot assign residue numbers use the HNi and HNi+1 NOEs, and then the HBi and HNi+1 NOEs.

** PROCEDURE OUTLINE **

* Overlay the TOCSY and NOESY spectra in Sparky. Consult the TOCSY patterns at http://www.bp.uni-bayreuth.de/NMR/nmr_alltocsy.html (red diamons=only in TOCSY, blue
  circles=both in COSY and TOCSY)
* Overlay the TOCSY and 1D proton spectra in Topspin.
* Integrate one peak that you are sure that corresponds to only one HN. Now integrate the rest of the peaks to find out if they are singlets, dublets, triplets, etc.
* Try to mark first and then identify as many HN as you can using the integrals in the 1D spectrum and the overlaid 1D+2D TOCSY spectra.
* Peaks exactly below HA peaks correspond to water absorption (~4.8 ppm). Ignore them!
* Try to assign as many H?-HN, H?-HA, H?-HB, etc. peaks as you can. The 1st residue in the sequence does not appear in the spectum, whereas the 2nd residues HN is the most left7
* Use the HA(i)-HN(i+1) NOEs to assign as many peaks as you can to atoms/residues. Sparky identifies the closest atom resonance when you try to add labels.
* Use the HN(i)-HN(i+1) NOEs to assign as many peaks as you can to atoms/residues. Sparky identifies the closest atom resonance when you try to add labels.
  Strong HN(i)-HN(i+1) NOEs are characteristic of alpha- and 3/10-helical structures (~2.8 A, ~2.6 A) and turn I (~2.6 A).
* Use the HB(i)-HN(i+1) NOEs to assign as many peaks as you can to atoms/residues. Sparky identifies the closest atom resonance when you try to add labels.
* Use the rest of the NOEs to assign as many more atoms as you can. Sparky identifies the closest atom resonance when you try to add labels.
* Find the HE or Arg,Gln,Asn,Lys,His,Trp to
* Search for alpha- or 3/10 helices by identifyings strong HN(i)-HN(i+1) (~2.8 A, ~2.6 A) and HA(i)-HN(i+3) NOES (~3.5 A), HA(i)-HB(i+3).
